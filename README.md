# AntiTamperEOF
A little project which shows how to create a basic AntiTamper with DNLIB


Just a show off about Dnlib and Antitamper.

It will take the MD5 of the target, put it as a byte, and write it at the EndOfFile.
Then a method is injected in the GlobalType, also knwon as <'Module'>.

Code is partially commented, perfect for newbies.
